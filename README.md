# Plotly_deployment

## Overview
This project will allow a data dashboard to be built using the Plotly JavaScript library to organize and display charts based on study data. Roza worked with Improbable Beef to develop synthetic beef from 10 types of bacteria.

### Results
The dashboard allowed for the comprehensible data to be used. Several files were created including index.html and charts.js files to pull data on samples.json file. The data gathered was used to display as an interactive dashboard.
